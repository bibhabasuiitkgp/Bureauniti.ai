"Recording for the demonstration" is grammatically correct, but it could be more specific for clarity. Here are some possible revisions:

* Recording for the product demonstration
* Demonstration recording
* Recording of the product demonstration
* Product demonstration recording

The choice of wording depends on the context and the intended audience.
